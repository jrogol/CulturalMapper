# Cultural Mapper
Data Science Institute Capstone Project Class of 2017

We are mapping out subpopulations using twitter data.

#Data
We listened and stored tweets in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Istanbul for 3 months, 10/16-1/16. The data needed considerable cleaning, parsing, and processing. 

#Procedure
After we collapsed all tweets by the same author we separated the tweets by language group. These language groups were used as corpora for topic modeling.
